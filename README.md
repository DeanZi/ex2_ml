### Machine Learning Models Implementation
This code provides an implementation of four machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Perceptron, and Passive Aggressive (PA).

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* scikit-learn

### Models

The implemented models are:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The k-NN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity, so it predicts the label of a new instance based on the labels of the k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

* Support Vector Machine (SVM): a supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis. The SVM algorithm tries to find the best hyperplane that separates the different classes of data points in the training set.

* Perceptron: a linear classifier used for binary classification problems. The perceptron algorithm tries to find the weights that minimize the classification error on the training data.

* Passive Aggressive (PA): a family of algorithms used for online learning. PA algorithms update the model parameters based on the observed training data in an incremental fashion.

### Dataset
The code uses the Iris flowers dataset, a commonly used dataset in machine learning.
